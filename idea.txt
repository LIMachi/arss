analog redstone suite (arss):

************************************************************************************************************************
bug: enriched/perfected redstone does not work in slopes (going up/down a block)
missing models and textures
************************************************************************************************************************

change:
    depurated redstone could work like this:
    every 16 blocks or when changing to redstone wire (direct or indirect) -> loose 1 power, otherwise similar to redstone

    CRC C: Raw Copper
OK  RIR R: Redstone -> 8x epurated redstone blend -> Blast -> 8x epurated redstone
    CRC I: Raw Iron (model: cleaner redstone with different orangish color)

OK  CH HC C: Comparator -> 1x Memory module, 3 modes: set/reset on lateral input or auto (keep last non null signal)
    HC CH R: High Fidelity Redstone (model: base sided, center 0-15 colored, center border modal)

     R  Q: Quartz
OK  TQT R/T: Redstone (torch) -> 1x Adder 2 modes: add with max/add with rounding
    SSS S: Stone (model: similar to comparator, different base)

OK  CTC C: Comparator -> 2x Checker 2 modes: ==/XOR
        T: Redstone Torch (model: similar to comparator, different base)

    BBB C: Comparator
OK  BCB B: Stone Button -> 8x Analog Button (shift-left to change signal strength)
    BBB                 (model: base button + layer)

OK  LLL C: Comparator
    LCL L: Lever -> 8x Analog Lever (shift-left to change signal strength)
    LLL                 (model: base lever + layer)

OK  TTT C: Comparator
    TCT T: Redstone Torch -> 8x Analog Torch (shift-left to change signal strength)
    TTT                 (model: base torch + layer)

OK  OC O: Observer
       C: Comparator -> 2x Analog Edge Detector 2 modes: rising/lowering
                        (model: similar to comparator, different base)

OK  RRR R: Redstone
    RCR C: Comparator -> 1x Analog Redstone Block (same as a redstone block, power is configurable)
    RRR

OK  demuxer (emit binary signal 0/15 if bit 1/2/4/8 is on)

OK  delayer (slows signal by x ticks, x = side strength + 1, keep original signal strength and order, changing side signal will either compress or expand the signal)

OK  analog note block (note played is dependent on signal strength)

OK  analog lamp (light level is dependent on signal strength)

OK  signal generator (modes: random/triangle/square/saw/sine)

    analog jukebox: has an inventory with 15 slots for the 15 disks, when powered, the signal strength is used to select a disk to play

OK  analog or -> combines signal as if demuxed -> ored -> remuxed

OK  analog nor -> combines signal as if demuxed -> nored -> remuxed

OK  analog and -> combines signal as if demuxed -> anded -> remuxed

OK  analog nand -> combines signal as if demuxed -> anded -> remuxed

OK  analog xor -> combines signal as if demuxed -> xored -> remuxed

OK  analog xnor -> combines signal as if demuxed -> xnored -> remuxed
