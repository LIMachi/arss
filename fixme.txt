OK sequencer should not drop with nbt when empty (head/length 0, no limits and 0 power everywhere)
OK? sequencer should sync their data in a way that prevent desync when multiple players are using the screen at the same time
OK? add better edit tools for sequencer (selection, copy, cut, paste, shift up, shift down, quantize, etc...)
OK? fix play/pause being hard to use in boosted mode (in normal mode, screen ticks twice as fast as the entity, so space has a very high chance of winning, but in boosted mode, screen and entity tick at the same speed)
OK rework rendering of sequencer (sub sections dont render properly, need to add highlights)
OK? fix dispenser velocity calculation (shoots itself too often)

OK? sequencer skips first note when playing with space in play once mode
