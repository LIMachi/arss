all:
    missing icons
    missing models

note block:
    don't work with direct signal
    don't work twice with the same signal

diodes: FIXING
    don't work with item frames on sides

edge detector: OK
    rename 'lowering edge' to 'falling edge'

signal generator: OK
    upgrade: change how it works based on side signal
    saw/inverse_saw/triangle -> signal between sides if at least one side > 0
    square -> length of the timer between swap
    sine -> inverse length of timer of a revolution (0 signal 360 steps, 15 signal 22.5 steps)

redstone wires:
    should not receive signal from vanilla redstone wires
